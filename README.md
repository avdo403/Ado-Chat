## üöÄ Key Features

*   **üîå Multi-Backend Support**: Seamlessly switch between different model providers:
    *   **Ollama**: Run models locally for privacy and offline access.
    *   **Google AI Studio (Gemini)**: Leverage Google's powerful Gemini family of models.
    *   **NVIDIA AI Foundation**: Access cutting-edge models hosted by NVIDIA.
*   **ü§ñ Advanced Agent Mode**: Unleash the full potential of your AI with two powerful execution modes:
    *   **Single Agent**: A standard agent that uses tools to accomplish tasks.
    *   **Crew Mode**: A more advanced mode that uses a "Planner" agent to break down complex tasks and an "Executor" agent to complete each step, enabling more robust and complex problem-solving.
*   **üõ†Ô∏è Rich Toolset**: Equip your agent with a wide range of capabilities:
    *   **Web Research**: Perform single or multiple parallel web searches, read web content intelligently, and summarize URLs.
    *   **File System**: List, read, and write files directly within a secure workspace.
    *   **Code Execution**: Run Python code in a persistent environment to perform calculations, data analysis, and more.
    *   **Long-term Memory**: Give your agent the ability to remember and recall information across conversations.
    *   **Interactive Browser**: (Experimental) Allow the agent to open URLs, click elements, and type text in a controlled browser environment.
*   **Modern UI/UX**:
    *   **Markdown & Code Highlighting**: Richly formatted messages for better readability.
    *   **Streaming Responses**: Get real-time feedback as the agent "thinks" and generates a response.
    *   **Agent Task Visualization**: Clearly see the agent's thought process, the tools it uses, and the results of each step.
    *   **Dark/Light Mode**: A sleek interface that adapts to your preference.
    *   **Conversation Management**: Easily create, manage, and delete multiple conversations.
*   **Secure & Local First**:
